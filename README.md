Project 1: Speech Recognition System using MATLAB
DESCRIPTION:
The project takes human speech as input, recognizes the spoken word and performs action accordingly. This also includes speech coding which is the first step in wireless communications. The platform used to build this project is MATLAB. 
Project 2: Mobile Network OSS Billing System using C++
DESCRIPTION:
The project takes user data and voice usage from the core network of the wireless system and does the billing according to the policies stated by the HSS (Home Subscriber Subsystem) and performs action accordingly. The whole program code is based on C++. 
Project 3:  Heart Rate meter using AT89C2051 Microcontroller
DESCRIPTION: 
The project describes a microcontroller heart rate measurement system that uses optical sensors to measure the alteration in blood volume at fingertip with each heartbeat. The user places the finger on top of the sensor, and then the heart rate is displayed on the LCD screen using 8051 micro controller. The programming is done using C language.
